gaze tracking; student modeling; attentionaware.\\n\\n1. introduction\\ndespite our best efforts to write a clear and engaging paper,\\nchances are high that within the next 10 pages you might fall prey\\nto what is referred to as zoning out, daydreaming, or mind\\nwandering [45]. despite your best intention to concentrate on our\\npaper, at some point your attention might drift away to unrelated\\nthoughts of lunch, childcare, or an upcoming trip. this prediction\\nis not based on some negative or cynical opinion of the\\nreader/reviewer (we read and review papers too), but on what is\\nknown about attentional control, vigilance, and concentration\\nwhile individuals are engaged in complex comprehension\\nactivities, such as reading for understanding.\\none recent study tracked mind wandering of 5,000 individuals\\nfrom 83 countries with a smartphone app that prompted people\\nwith thought-probes at random intervals throughout the day [24].\\npeople reported mind wandering for 46.9% of the prompts, which\\nconfirmed lab studies on the pervasiveness of mind wandering\\n(see [45] for a review). mind wandering is more than merely\\nincidental; a recent meta-analysis of 88 samples indicated a\\nnegative correlation between mind wandering and performance\\nacross a variety of tasks [34], a correlation which increases with\\ntask complexity. when compounded with its high frequency,\\nmind wandering can have serious consequences on the\\nperformance and productivity of society at large.\\n\\nof learning with technology. traditional learning technologies\\nrely on the assumption that students are attending to the learning\\nsession, although this is not always the case. for example, it has\\nbeen estimated that students mind wander approximately 40% of\\nthe time when engaging with online lectures [38], which are an\\nimportant component of moocs. some advanced technologies\\ndo aim to detect and respond to affective states like boredom, but\\nevidence for their effectiveness is still equivocal (see [9] for a\\nreview). further, boredom is related to but not the same as\\nattention [12]. there are technologies that aim to prevent mind\\nwandering by engendering a highly immersive learning\\nexperience and have achieved some success in this regard [40,\\n41]. but what is to be done when attentional focus inevitably\\nwanes as the session progresses and the novelty of the system and\\ncontent fades?\\nour central thesis is that next-generation learning technologies\\nshould include mechanisms to model and respond to learners’\\nattention in real-time [8]. such attention-aware technologies can\\nmodel various aspects of learner attention (e.g., divided attention,\\nalternating attention). here, we focus on detecting and mitigating\\nmind wandering, a quintessential signal of waning engagement.\\nwe situate our work in the context of reading because reading is\\na common activity shared across multiple learning technologies,\\nthereby increasing the generalizability of our results. further,\\nstudents mind wander approximately 30% of the time during\\ncomputerized reading [44]. and although mind wandering can\\nfacilitate certain cognitive processes like future planning and\\ndivergent thinking [2, 28], it negatively correlates with\\ncomprehension and learning (reviewed in [31, 45]), suggesting\\nthat it is important to address mind wandering during learning.\\ntowards this end, we developed and validated a closed-loop\\nattention-aware learning technology that combines a machinelearned mind wandering detector with a real-time interpolated\\ntesting and re-study intervention. our attention-aware technology\\nworks as follows. learners read a text on a computer screen using\\na self-paced screen-by-screen (also called page-by-page) reading\\nparadigm. we track eye-gaze during reading using a remote eye\\ntracker that does not restrict head movements. we focus on eyegaze for mind wandering detection due to decades of research\\nsuggesting a tight coupling between attentional focus and eye\\nmovements during reading [36]. when mind wandering is\\ndetected, the system intervenes in an attempt to redirect\\nattentional focus and correct any comprehension deficits that\\nmight arise due to mind wandering. the interventions consist of\\nasking comprehension question on pages where mind wandering\\nwas detected and providing opportunities to re-read based on\\nlearners’ responses. in this paper, we discuss the mind wandering\\n\\nmind wandering is also unfortunately an under-addressed\\nproblem in education and is yet to be deeply studied in the context8\\n\\n\\x0cdetector, intervention approach, and results of a summative\\nevaluation study 1.\\n\\n1.1 related work\\nthe idea of attention-aware user interfaces is not new, but was\\nproposed almost a decade ago by roda and thomas [39]. there\\nwas even an article on futuristic applications of attention-aware\\nsystems in educational contexts [35]. prior to this, gluck, et al.\\n[15] discussed the use of eye tracking to increase the bandwidth\\nof information available to an intelligent tutoring system (its).\\nsimilarly, anderson [1] followed up on some of these ideas by\\ndemonstrating how particular beneficial instructional strategies\\ncould only be launched via a real-time analysis of eye gaze.\\nmost of the recent work has been on leveraging eye gaze to\\nincrease the bandwidth of learner models [22, 23, 29]. conati, et\\nal. [5] provide an excellent review of much of the existing work\\nin this area. we can group the research into three categories: (1)\\noffline-analyses of eye gaze to study attentional processes, (2)\\ncomputational modeling of attentional states, and (3) closed-loop\\nsystems that respond to attention in real-time. offline-analysis of\\neye movements has received considerable attention in cognitive\\nand educational psychology for several decades [e.g., 16, 19], so\\nthis area of research is relatively healthy. online computational\\nmodels of learner attention are just beginning to emerge [e.g., 6,\\n11], while closed-loop attention-aware systems are few and far\\nbetween (see [7, 15, 42, 48] for a more or less exhaustive list).\\ntwo known examples, gazetutor and attentivereview, are\\ndiscussed below.\\ngazetutor [7] is a learning technology for biology. it has an\\nanimated conversational agent that provides spoken explanations\\non biology topics which are synchronized with images. the\\nsystem uses a tobii t60 eye tracker to detect inattention, which\\nis assumed to occur when learners’ gaze is not on the tutor agent\\nor image for at least five consecutive seconds. when this occurs,\\nthe system interrupts its speech mid utterance, directs learners to\\nreorient their attention (e.g., “i’m over here you know”), and\\nrepeats speaking from the start of the current utterance. in an\\nevaluation study, 48 learners (undergraduate students) completed\\na learning session on four biology topics with the attention-aware\\ncomponents enabled (experimental group) or disabled (control\\ngroup). the results indicated that gazetutor was successful in\\ndynamically reorienting learners’ attentional patterns towards the\\ninterface. importantly, learning gains for deep reasoning\\nquestions were significantly higher for the experimental vs.\\ncontrol group, but only for high aptitude learners. the results\\nsuggest that even the most basic attention-aware technology can\\nbe effective in improving learning, at least for a subset of learners.\\nhowever, a key limitation is that the researchers simply assumed\\nthat off-screen gaze corresponded to inattention, but did not test\\nthis assumption (e.g., students could have been concentrating\\nwith their eyes closed and this would have been perceived as\\nbeing inattentive).\\nattentivereview [32] is a closed-loop system for mooc learning\\non mobile phones. the system uses video-based\\nphotoplethysmography (ppg) to detect a learners’ heart rate from\\nthe back camera of a smartphone while they view mooc-like\\nlectures on the phone. attentivereview ranks the lectures based\\n1\\n\\non its estimates of learners’ “perceived difficulty,” selecting the\\nmost difficult lecture for subsequent review (called adaptive\\nreview). in a 32-participant between-subjects evaluation study,\\nthe authors found that learning gains obtained from the adaptive\\nreview condition were statistically on par with a full review\\ncondition, but were achieved in 66.7% less review time. although\\nthis result suggests that attentivereview increased learning\\nefficiency, there is the question as to whether the system should\\neven be considered to be an “attention-aware” technology. this is\\nbecause it is arguable if the system has anything to do with\\nattention (except for “attention” appearing in its name) as it\\nselects items for review based on a model of “perceived\\ndifficulty” and not on learners’ “attentional state.” the two might\\nbe related, but are clearly not the same.\\n\\n1.2 novelty\\nour paper focuses on closing the loop between research on\\neducational data and learning outcomes by developing and\\nvalidating the first (in our view) real-time learning technology\\nthat detects and mitigates mind wandering during computerized\\nreading. although automated detection of complex mental states\\nwith the goal of developing intelligent learning technologies that\\nrespond to the sensed states is an active research area (see reviews\\nby [9, 18]), mind wandering has rarely been explored as an aspect\\nof a learner’s mental state that warrants detection and corrective\\naction. and while there has been some work on modeling the\\nlocus of learner attention (see review by [5]), mind wandering is\\ninherently different than more commonly studied forms of\\nattention (e.g., selective attention, distraction), because it involves\\nmore covert forms of involuntary attentional lapses spawned by\\nself-generated internal thought [45]. simply put, mind wandering\\nis a form of “looking without seeing” because the eyes might be\\nfixated on the appropriate external stimulus, but very little is\\nbeing processed as the mind is consumed by stimulusindependent internal thoughts. offline automated approaches to\\ndetect mind wandering have been developed (e.g., [3, 11, 27, 33]),\\nbut these detectors have not yet been used to trigger online\\ninterventions. here, we adapt an offline gaze-based automated\\nmind wandering detector [13] to trigger real-time interventions to\\naddress mind wandering during reading. we conduct a\\nrandomized control trial to evaluate the efficacy of our attentionaware learning technology in improving learning.\\n\\n2. mind wandering detection\\nwe adopted a supervised learning approach for mind wandering\\ndetection. below we provide a high-level overview of the\\napproach; readers are directed to [3, 13] for a detailed discussion\\nof the general approach used to build gaze-based detectors of\\nmind wandering.\\n\\n2.1 training data\\nwe obtained training data from a previous study [26] that\\ninvolved 98 undergraduate students reading a 57-page text on the\\nsurface tension of liquids [4] on a computer screen for an average\\nof 28 minutes. the text contained around 6500 words, with an\\naverage of 115 words per page, and was displayed on a computer\\nscreen with courier new typeface. we recorded eye-gaze with a\\ntobii tx300 eye tracker set to a sampling frequency of 120 hz.\\n\\nthis paper reports updated results of an earlier version [10] presented\\nas a “late-breaking work” (lbw) poster at the 2016 acm chi\\nconference. lbw “extended abstracts” are not included in the main\\nconference proceedings and copyright is retained by the authors.9\\n\\n\\x0cparticipants could read normally and were free to move or gesture\\nas they pleased.\\nparticipants were instructed to report mind wandering (during\\nreading) by pressing a predetermined key when they found\\nthemselves “thinking about the task itself but not the actual\\ncontent of the text” or when they were “thinking about anything\\nelse besides the task.” this is consistent with contemporary\\napproaches (see [45]) that rely on self-reporting because mind\\nwandering is an internal conscious phenomena. further, selfreports of mind wandering have been linked to predictable\\npatterns in physiology [43], pupillometry [14], eye-gaze [37], and\\ntask performance [34], providing validity for this approach.\\n\\non the page, we classified the page as a positive instance of mind\\nwandering. this was done because analyses indicated that\\nparticipants were more likely to be mind wandering in those cases\\n(but see [13] for alternate strategies to handle missing instances).\\n\\non average, we received mind wandering reports for 32% of the\\npages (sd = 20%), although there was considerable variability\\namong participants (ranging from 0% to 82%). self-reported\\nmind wandering negatively correlated (r = -.23, p < .05) with\\nscores on a subsequent comprehension assessment [26], which\\nprovides evidence for the predictive validity of the self-reports.\\n\\n2.2 model building\\nthe stream of eye-gaze data was filtered to produce a series of\\nfixations, saccades, and blinks, from which global eye gaze\\nfeatures were extracted (see figure 1). global features are\\nindependent of the words being read and are therefore more\\ngeneralizable than so-called local features. a full list of 62 global\\nfeatures along with detailed descriptions is provided in [13], but\\nbriefly the features can be grouped into the following four\\ncategories: (1) eye movement descriptive features (n = 48) were\\nstatistical functionals (e.g., min, median) for fixation duration,\\nsaccade duration, saccade amplitude, saccade velocity, and\\nrelative and absolute saccade angle distributions; (2) pupil\\ndiameter descriptive features were statistical functionals (n = 8)\\ncomputed from participant-level z-score standardized estimates\\nof pupil diameter; (3) blink features (n = 2) consisted of the\\nnumber of blinks and the mean blink duration; (4) miscellaneous\\ngaze features (n = 4) consisted of the number of saccades,\\nhorizontal saccade proportion, fixation dispersion, and the\\nfixation duration/saccade duration ratio. we proceeded with a\\nsubset of 32 features after eliminating features exhibiting\\nmulticollinearity.\\nfeatures were calculated from only a certain amount of gaze data\\nfrom each page, called the window. the end of the window was\\npositioned 3 seconds before a self-report so as to not overlap with\\nthe key-press. the average amount of time between self-reports\\nand the beginning of the page was 16 seconds. we used this time\\npoint as the end of the window for pages with no self-report.\\npages that were shorter than the target window size were\\ndiscarded, as were pages with windows that contained fewer than\\nfive gaze fixations as there was insufficient data to compute some\\nof the features. there were a total of 4,225 windows with\\nsufficient data for supervised classification.\\nwe experimented with a number of supervised classifiers on\\nwindow sizes of 4, 8, and 12 seconds to discriminate positive\\n(pages with a self-report = 32%) from negative (pages without a\\nself-report) instances of mind wandering. the training data were\\ndownsampled to achieve a 50% base rate; testing data were\\nunaltered. a leave-one-participant-out validation approach was\\nadopted where models were built on data from n-1 participants\\nand evaluated on the held-out participant. the process was\\nrepeated for all participants. model validation was conducted in a\\nway to simulate a real-time system by analyzing data from every\\npage. when classification was not possible due to a lack of valid\\ngaze data and/or because participants did not spend enough time\\n\\nfigure 1: gaze fixations during mind wandering (top)\\nand normal reading (bottom)\\n\\n2.3 detector accuracy\\nthe best model was a support vector machine that used global\\nfeatures and operated on a window size of 8-seconds. the area\\nunder the roc curve (auc or auroc or a’) was .66, which\\nexceeds the 0.5 chance threshold [17].\\nwe assigned each instance as mind wandering or not mind\\nwandering based on whether the detector’s predicted likelihood\\nof mind wandering (ranges from 0 to 1) was below or above 0.5\\nwe adopted the default 0.5 threshold as it led to a higher rate of\\ntrue positives while maintaining a moderate rate of true negatives.\\nthis resulted in the following confusion matrix shown in table 1.\\nthe model had a weighted precision of 72.2% and a weighted\\nrecall of 67.4%, which we deemed to be sufficiently accurate for\\nintervention.\\ntable 1: proportionalized confusion matrix for mind\\nwandering detection\\npredicted mind wandering

intervention approach is grounded in the basic idea that\\nlearning of conceptual information involves creating and\\nmaintaining an internal model (mental model) by integrating\\ninformation from the text with prior knowledge from memory\\n[25]. this integration process relies on attentional focus and\\nbreaks down during mind wandering because information from\\nthe external environment is no longer being integrated into the\\ninternal mental model. this results in an impaired model which\\nleads to less effective suppression of off-task thoughts. this\\nincrease in mind wandering further impairs the mental model,10\\n\\n\\x0cresulting in a vicious cycle. our intervention targets this vicious\\ncycle by redirecting attention to the primary task and attempting\\nto correct for comprehension deficits attributed to mind\\nwandering. based on research demonstrating the effectiveness of\\ninterpolated testing [47], we propose that asking questions on\\npages where mind wandering is detected and encouraging rereading in response to incorrect responses will aid in re-directing\\nattention to the text and correct knowledge deficits.\\n\\npage regardless of whether the second question was answered\\ncorrectly, so as not to be overly burdensome.\\n\\n3.1 intervention implementation\\nour initial intervention was implemented for the same text used\\nto create the mind wandering detector (although it could be\\napplied to any text). the text was integrated into the computer\\nreading interface. mind wandering detection occurred when the\\nlearner navigated to the next page using the right arrow key. in\\norder to address ambiguity in mind wandering detection, we used\\nthe detector’s mind wandering likelihood to probabilistically\\ndetermine when to intervene. for example, if the mind wandering\\nlikelihood was 70%, then there was a 70% chance of intervention\\non any given page (all else being equal). we did not intervene for\\nthe first three pages in order to allow the learner to become\\nfamiliar with the text and interface. to reduce disruption, there\\nwas a 50% reduced probability of intervening on adjacent pages,\\nand the maximum number of interventions was capped at 1/3 ×\\nthe number of pages (19 for the present 57-page text). table 2\\npresents pseudo code for when to launch an intervention.\\ntable 2: pseudo code for intervention strategy\\nlaunch_intervention:\\nif current_page >= waitpages\\nand\\ntotal_interventions < maxintrv)\\nand\\ngaze_likelihood > random(0,1)\\nand\\n(!has_intervened(previous_page)\\nor 0.5 < random

presents an outline of the intervention strategy. the\\nintervention itself relied on two multiple choice questions for\\neach page (screen) of the text. when the system decided to\\nintervene, one of the questions (randomly selected) was presented\\nto the learner. if the learner answered this online question\\ncorrectly, positive feedback was provided, and the learner could\\nadvance to the next page. if the learner answered incorrectly,\\nnegative feedback was provided, and the system encouraged the\\nlearner to re-read the page. the learner was then provided with a\\nsecond (randomly selected) online question, which could either\\nbe the same or the alternate question for that page. feedback was\\nnot provided and the learner was allowed to advance to the next\\n\\nfigure 2: outline of intervention strategy\\n\\n3.2 iterative refinement\\nthe technology was refined through multiple rounds of formative\\ntesting with 67 participants, recruited from the same institution\\nused to build the detector. participants were observed while\\ninteracting with the technology, their responses were analyzed,\\nand they were interviewed about their experience. we used the\\nfeedback gleaned from these tests to refine the intervention\\nparameters (i.e., when to launch, how many interventions to\\nlaunch, whether to launch interventions on subsequent pages),\\nintervention questions themselves, and instructions on how to\\nattend to the intervention. for example, earlier versions of the\\nintervention used a fixed threshold (instead of the aforementioned\\nprobabilistic approach) to trigger an intervention. despite many\\nattempts to set this threshold, the end result was that some\\nparticipants received many interventions while others received\\nalmost no interventions. this issue was corrected by\\nprobabilistically rather than deterministically launching the\\nintervention. additional testing/refinement of the comprehension\\nquestions used in the intervention was done using crowdsourcing\\nplatforms, specifically amazon’s mechanical turk (mturk).\\n\\n4. evaluation study\\nwe conducted a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the\\ntechnology. the experiment had two conditions: an intervention\\ncondition and a yoked control condition (as described below). the\\nyoked control was needed to verify that any learning benefits are\\nattributed to the technology being sensitive to mind wandering\\nand not merely to the added opportunities to answer online\\nquestions and re-read. this is because we know that interpolated\\ntesting itself has beneficial comprehension effects [47].\\n\\n4.1 method\\nparticipants (n = 104) were a new set of undergraduate students\\nwho participated to fulfill research credit requirements. they\\nwere recruited from the same university used to build the mw\\ndetector and for the iterative testing and refinement cycles.\\nwe did not use a pretest because we expected participants to be\\nunfamiliar with the topic. participants were not informed that the\\ninterface would be tracking their mind wandering (until the11\\n\\n\\x0cdebriefing at the end), instead, they were instructed as follows:\\n“while reading the text, you will occasionally be asked some\\nquestions about the page you just read. depending on your\\nanswer, you will re-read the same page and you will be asked\\nanother question that may or may not be the same question.”\\nparticipants in the intervention condition received the\\nintervention as described above (i.e., based on detected mind\\nwandering likelihoods). each participant in the yoked control\\ncondition was paired with a participant in the intervention\\ncondition. he or she received an intervention question on the\\nsame pages as their paired intervention participant regardless of\\nmind wandering likelihood. for example, if participant a (i.e.,\\nintervention condition) received questions on pages 5, 7, 10, and\\n25, participant b (i.e., yoked control condition) would receive\\nintervention questions on the same pages. however, if the yoked\\nparticipant answered incorrectly, then (s)he had the opportunity\\nto re-read and answer another question regardless of the outcome\\nof their intervention-condition partner.\\nafter reading, participants completed a 38-item multiple choice\\ncomprehension assessment to measure learning. the questions\\nwere randomly selected from the 57 pages (one per page) with the\\nexception that a higher selection priority was given to pages that\\nwere re-read on account of the intervention. participants in the\\nyoked control condition received the same posttest questions as\\ntheir intervention condition counterparts.\\n\\n4.2 results\\nparticipants received an average of 16 (min of 7 and max of 19)\\ninterventions. they spent an average of 27.5 seconds on each\\nscreen prior to receiving an intervention. there was no significant\\ndifference across conditions (p = .998), suggesting that reading\\ntime was not a confound. in what follows, we compared each\\nintervention participant to his/her yoked control with a two-tailed\\npaired-samples t-test and a 0.05 criteria for statistical\\nsignificance.\\nmind wandering detection. the detector’s likelihood of mind\\nwandering was slightly higher for participants in the yokedcontrol condition (m = .431; sd = .170) compared to the\\nintervention condition (m = .404; sd = .112), but the difference\\nwas not statistically significant (p = .348). this was unsurprising\\nas participants in both groups received the same interventions,\\nwhich itself was expected to reduce mind wandering. importantly,\\nmind wandering likelihoods were negatively correlated with\\nperformance on the online questions (r = -.296, p = .033) as well\\nas on posttest questions (r = -.319, p = .021). this provides\\nevidence for the validity of the mind wandering detector when\\napplied to a new set of learners and under different conditions\\n(i.e., reading interspersed with online questions compared to\\nuninterrupted reading).\\ncomprehension assessment. there was some overlap between\\nthe online questions and the posttest questions. to obtain an\\nunbiased estimate of learning, we only analyzed performance on\\npreviously unseen posttest questions. that is, questions that were\\nused as part of the intervention were first removed before\\ncomputing posttest scores.\\nthere were no significant condition differences on overall\\nposttest scores (p = .846). the intervention condition answered\\n57.6% (sd = .157) of the questions correctly while the yoked\\ncontrol condition answered 58.1% (sd = .129) correctly. this\\nfinding was not surprising as both conditions received the exact\\nsame treatment except that the interventions were triggered based\\n\\non detected mind wandering in the intervention condition but not\\nthe control condition.\\nnext, we examined posttest performance as a function of mind\\nwandering during reading. each page was designated as a low or\\nhigh mind wandering page based on a median split of mind\\nwandering likelihoods (medians = .35 and .36 on a 0 to 1 scale for\\nintervention and control conditions, respectively). we then\\nanalyzed performance on posttest questions corresponding to\\npages with low vs. high likelihoods of mind wandering (during\\nreading). the results are shown in table 3.\\nwe found no significant posttest differences on pages where both\\nthe intervention and control participants had low (p = .759) or\\nhigh (p = .922) mind wandering likelihoods (first and last rows in\\ntable 3, respectively). there was also no significant posttest\\ndifference (p = .630) for pages where the intervention condition\\nhad high mind wandering likelihoods but the control condition\\nhad low mind wandering likelihoods (row 3). however, the\\nintervention condition significantly (p = .003, d = .47 sigma)\\noutperformed the control condition for pages where the\\nintervention participants had low likelihoods of mind wandering\\nbut control participants had high mind wandering likelihoods\\n(row 2). these last two finding suggests that the intervention had\\nthe intended effect of reducing comprehension deficits\\nattributable to mind wandering because it led to equitable\\nperformance when mind wandering was high and improved\\nperformance when it was low.\\ntable 3: posttest performance (proportion of correct\\nresponses) as a function of mind wandering

subjective experience with the\\nintervention. a few key themes emerged. participants reported\\npaying closer attention to the text after realizing they would be\\nperiodically answering multiple-choice questions. this was good.\\nhowever, participants also reported that they adapted their\\nreading strategies in one of two ways in response to the questions.\\nsince the questions targeted factual information (sometimes\\nverbatim) from the text, some participants paid more attention to\\ndetails and precise wordings instead of the broader concepts being\\ndiscussed in the text. more discouragingly, some participants\\nreported adopting a preemptive skimming strategy in that they\\nwould only look for keywords that they expected to appear in a\\nsubsequent question.\\nparticipants were encouraged to re-read text when they answered\\nincorrectly before receiving another question (or the same\\nquestion in some cases). many participants reported simply\\nscanning the text (when re-reading) to locate keywords from the\\nquestion before moving on. since the scanning strategy was often12\\n\\n\\x0csuccessful to answer the subsequent question, participants\\nreported that the questions were too easy and it took relatively\\nlittle effort to locate the correct answer compared to re-reading.\\nthey suggested that it may have been better if the questions had\\ntargeted key concepts rather than facts.\\nfinally, participants reported difficulties with re-engaging with\\nthe text after answering an online question because the text was\\ncleared when an intervention question was displayed; an item that\\ncan be easily corrected in subsequent versions.\\n\\n5. discussion\\nwe developed the first educational technology capable of realtime mind wandering detection and dynamic intervention during\\ncomputerized reading. in the remainder of this section, we discuss\\nthe significance of our main findings, limitations, and avenues for\\nfuture work.\\n\\n5.1 significance of main findings\\nwe have three main findings. first, we demonstrated that a\\nmachine-learned mind wandering detector built in one context\\ncan be applied to a different (albeit related) interaction context.\\nspecifically, the detector was trained on a data set involving\\nparticipants silently reading and self-reporting mind wandering,\\nbut was applied to an interactive context involving interpolated\\nassessments, which engendered different reading strategies.\\nfurther, self-reports of mind wandering were not collected in this\\ninteractive context, which might have influenced mind wandering\\nrates in and of itself. despite these differences, we were able to\\ndemonstrate the predictive validity of the detector by showing\\nthat it negatively correlated with both online and offline\\ncomprehension scores when evaluated on new participants.\\nsecond, we showed promising effects for our intervention\\napproach despite a very conservative experimental design, which\\nensured that the intervention and control groups were equated\\nalong all respects, except that the intervention was triggered based\\non the mind wandering detector (key manipulation). further, we\\nused a probabilistic approach to trigger an intervention, because\\nthe detector is inherently imperfect. as a result, participants could\\nhave received an intervention when they were not mind\\nwandering and/or could have failed to receive one when they were\\nmind wandering. therefore, it was essential to compare the two\\ngroups under conditions when the mind wandering levels\\ndiffered. this more nuanced analysis revealed that although the\\nintervention itself did not lead to a boost in overall comprehension\\n(because it is remedial), it equated comprehension scores when\\nmind wandering was high (i.e., scores for the intervention group\\nwere comparable when the control group was low on mind\\nwandering). it also demonstrated the cost of not intervening\\nduring mind wandering (i.e., scores for the intervention group\\nwere greater when the control group was high on mind\\nwandering). in other words, the intervention was successful in\\nmitigating the negative effects of mind wandering.\\nthird, despite the advantages articulated above, the intervention\\nitself was reactive and engendered several unintended (and\\npresumably suboptimal) behaviors. in particular, students altered\\ntheir reading strategies in response to the interpolated questions,\\nwhich were a critical part of the intervention. in a sense, they\\nattempted to “game the intervention” by attempting to proactively\\npredict the types of questions they might receive and then\\nadopting a complementary reading strategy consisting of\\nskimming and/or focusing on factual information. this reliance\\non surface- rather than deeper-levels of processing was\\nincongruent with our goal of promoting deep comprehension.\\n\\n5.2 limitations\\nthere are a number of methodological limitations with this work\\nthat go beyond limitations with the intervention (as discussed\\nabove). first, we focused on a single text that is perceived as\\nbeing quite dull and consequently triggers rather high levels of\\nmind wandering [26]. this raises the question of whether the\\ndetector will generalize to different texts. we expect some level\\nof generalizability in terms of features used because the detector\\nonly used content- and position- (on the screen) free global gaze\\nfeatures. however, given that several supervised classifiers are\\nvery sensitive to differences in base rates, the detector might overor under- predict mind wandering when applied to texts that\\nengender different rates of mind wandering. therefore, retraining\\nthe detector with a more diverse set of texts is warranted.\\nanother limitation is the scalability of our learning technology.\\nthe eye tracker we used was a cost-prohibitive tobii tx300 that\\nwill not scale beyond the laboratory. fortunately, commercialoff-the-shelf (cots) eye trackers, such as eye tribe and tobii\\neyex, can be used to surpass this limitation. it is an open question\\nas to whether the mind wandering detector can operate with\\nsimilar fidelity with these cots eye trackers. our use of global\\ngaze features which do not require high-precision eye tracking\\nholds considerable promise in this regard. nevertheless,\\nreplication with scalable eye trackers and/or scalable alternatives\\nto eye tracking (e.g., facial-feature tracking [46] or monitoring\\nreading patterns [27]) is an important next step (see section 5.3).\\nour use of surface-level questions for both the intervention and\\nthe subsequent comprehension assessment is also a limitation as\\nis the lack of a delayed comprehension assessment. it might be\\nthe case that the intervention effects manifest as richer encodings\\nin long-term memory, a possibility that cannot be addressed in the\\ncurrent experiment that only assessed immediate learning.\\nother limitations include a limited student sample (i.e.\\nundergraduates from a private midwestern college) and a\\nlaboratory setup. it is possible that the results would not\\ngeneralize to a more diverse student population or in more\\necological environments (but see below for evidence of\\ngeneralizability of the detector in classroom environments).\\nreplication with data from more diverse populations and\\nenvironments would be a necessary next step to increase the\\necological validity of this work.\\n\\n5.3 future work\\nour future work is progressing along two main fronts. one is to\\naddress limitations in the intervention and design of the\\nexperimental evaluation as discussed above. accordingly, we are\\nexploring alternative intervention strategies, such as: (a) tagging\\nitems for future re-study rather than interrupting participants\\nduring reading; (b) highlighting specific portions of the text as an\\novert cue to facilitate comprehension of critical information; (c)\\nasking fewer intervention questions, but selecting inference\\nquestions that target deeper levels of comprehension and that span\\nmultiple pages of the text; and (d) asking learners to engage in\\nreflection by providing written self-explanations of the textual\\ncontent. we are currently evaluating one such redesigned\\nintervention – open-ended questions targeting deeper levels of\\ncomprehension (item c). our revised experimental design taps\\nboth surface- and inference-level comprehension and assesses\\ncomprehension immediately after reading (to measure learning)\\nand after a one-week delay (to measure retention).\\nwe are also developing attention-aware versions of more\\ninteractive interfaces, such as learning with an intelligent tutoring13\\n\\n\\x0csystem called gurututor [30]. this project also addresses some\\nof the scalability concerns by replacing expensive research-grade\\neye tracking with cost-effective cots eye tracking (e.g., the eye\\ntribe or tobii eyex) and provides evidence for real-world\\ngeneralizability by collecting data in classrooms rather than the\\nlab. we recently tested our implementation on 135 students (total)\\nin a noisy computer-enabled high-school classroom where eyegaze of entire classes of students was collected during their\\nnormal class periods [20]. using a similar approach to the present\\nwork, we used the data to build and validate a studentindependent gaze-based mind wandering detector. the resultant\\nmind wandering detection accuracy (f1 of 0.59) was substantially\\ngreater than chance (f1 of 0.24) and outperformed earlier work on\\nthe same domain [21]. the next step is to develop interventions\\nthat redirect attention and correct learning deficiencies\\nattributable to mind wandering and to test the interventions in\\nreal-world environments. by doing so, we hope to advance our\\nfoundational vision of developing next-generation technologies\\nthat enhance the process and products of learning by “attending\\nto attention.”\\n\\n[6]\\n\\n[7]\\n\\n[8]\\n\\n[9]\\n\\n[10]\\n\\n[11]\\n\\n[12]\\nfigure 3: guru tutor interface overlaid with eye-gaze\\nobtained via the eyetribe\\n\\n[13]\\n\\n6.

      "we have three main findings. first, we demonstrated that a\n",
      "machine-learned mind wandering detector built in one context\n",
      "can be applied to a different (albeit related) interaction context.\n",
      "specifically, the detector was trained on a data set involving\n",
      "participants silently reading and self-reporting mind wandering,\n",
      "but was applied to an interactive context involving interpolated\n",
      "assessments, which engendered different reading strategies.\n",
      "further, self-reports of mind wandering were not collected in this\n",
      "interactive context, which might have influenced mind wandering\n",
      "rates in and of itself. despite these differences, we were able to\n",
      "demonstrate the predictive validity of the detector by showing\n",
      "that it negatively correlated with both online and offline\n",
      "comprehension scores when evaluated on new participants.\n",
      "second, we showed promising effects for our intervention\n",
      "approach despite a very conservative experimental design, which\n",
      "ensured that the intervention and control groups were equated\n",
      "along all respects, except that the intervention was triggered based\n",
      "on the mind wandering detector (key manipulation). further, we\n",
      "used a probabilistic approach to trigger an intervention, because\n",
      "the detector is inherently imperfect. as a result, participants could\n",
      "have received an intervention when they were not mind\n",
      "wandering and/or could have failed to receive one when they were\n",
      "mind wandering. therefore, it was essential to compare the two\n",
      "groups under conditions when the mind wandering levels\n",
      "differed. this more nuanced analysis revealed that although the\n",
      "intervention itself did not lead to a boost in overall comprehension\n",
      "(because it is remedial), it equated comprehension scores when\n",
      "mind wandering was high (i.e., scores for the intervention group\n",
      "were comparable when the control group was low on mind\n",
      "wandering). it also demonstrated the cost of not intervening\n",
      "during mind wandering (i.e., scores for the intervention group\n",
      "were greater when the control group was high on mind\n",

      "mitigating the negative effects of mind wandering.\n",
      "third, despite the advantages articulated above, the intervention\n",

      "there are a number of methodological limitations with this work\n",
      "that go beyond limitations with the intervention (as discussed\n",

      "being quite dull and consequently triggers rather high levels of\n",

      "['\\nmind wandering, defined as shifts in attention from task-related\\nprocessing to task-unrelated thoughts, is a ubiquitous\\nphenomenon that has a negative influence on performance and\\nproductivity in many contexts, including learning. we propose\\nthat next-generation learning technologies should have some\\nmechanism to detect and respond to mind wandering in real-time.\\ntowards this end, we developed a technology that automatically\\ndetects mind wandering from eye-gaze during learning from\\ninstructional texts. when mind wandering is detected, the\\ntechnology intervenes by posing just-in-time questions and\\nencouraging re-reading as needed. after multiple rounds of\\niterative refinement, we summatively compared the technology to\\na yoked-control in an experiment with 104 participants. the key\\ndependent variable was performance on a post-reading\\ncomprehension assessment. our results suggest that the\\ntechnology was successful in correcting comprehension deficits\\nattributed to mind wandering (d = .47 sigma) under specific\\nconditions, thereby highlighting the potential to improve learning\\nby “attending to attention.”\\n\\nkeywords\\nmind wandering; gaze tracking; student modeling; attentionaware.\\n\\n1. introduction\\ndespite our best efforts to write a clear and engaging paper,\\nchances are high that within the next 10 pages you might fall prey\\nto what is referred to as zoning out, daydreaming, or mind\\nwandering [45]. despite your best intention to concentrate on our\\npaper, at some point your attention might drift away to unrelated\\nthoughts of lunch, childcare, or an upcoming trip. this prediction\\nis not based on some negative or cynical opinion of the\\nreader/reviewer (we read and review papers too), but on what is\\nknown about attentional control, vigilance, and concentration\\nwhile individuals are engaged in complex comprehension\\nactivities, such as reading for understanding.\\none recent study tracked mind wandering of 5,000 individuals\\nfrom 83 countries with a smartphone app that prompted people\\nwith thought-probes at random intervals throughout the day [24].\\npeople reported mind wandering for 46.9% of the prompts, which\\nconfirmed lab studies on the pervasiveness of mind wandering\\n(see [45] for a review). mind wandering is more than merely\\nincidental; a recent meta-analysis of 88 samples indicated a\\nnegative correlation between mind wandering and performance\\nacross a variety of tasks [34], a correlation which increases with\\ntask complexity. when compounded with its high frequency,\\nmind wandering can have serious consequences on the\\nperformance and productivity of society at large.\\n\\nof learning with technology. traditional learning technologies\\nrely on the assumption that students are attending to the learning\\nsession, although this is not always the case. for example, it has\\nbeen estimated that students mind wander approximately 40% of\\nthe time when engaging with online lectures [38], which are an\\nimportant component of moocs. some advanced technologies\\ndo aim to detect and respond to affective states like boredom, but\\nevidence for their effectiveness is still equivocal (see [9] for a\\nreview). further, boredom is related to but not the same as\\nattention [12]. there are technologies that aim to prevent mind\\nwandering by engendering a highly immersive learning\\nexperience and have achieved some success in this regard [40,\\n41]. but what is to be done when attentional focus inevitably\\nwanes as the session progresses and the novelty of the system and\\ncontent fades?\\nour central thesis is that next-generation learning technologies\\nshould include mechanisms to model and respond to learners’\\nattention in real-time [8]. such attention-aware technologies can\\nmodel various aspects of learner attention (e.g., divided attention,\\nalternating attention). here, we focus on detecting and mitigating\\nmind wandering, a quintessential signal of waning engagement.\\nwe situate our work in the context of reading because reading is\\na common activity shared across multiple learning technologies,\\nthereby increasing the generalizability of our results. further,\\nstudents mind wander approximately 30% of the time during\\ncomputerized reading [44]. and although mind wandering can\\nfacilitate certain cognitive processes like future planning and\\ndivergent thinking [2, 28], it negatively correlates with\\ncomprehension and learning (reviewed in [31, 45]), suggesting\\nthat it is important to address mind wandering during learning.\\ntowards this end, we developed and validated a closed-loop\\nattention-aware learning technology that combines a machinelearned mind wandering detector with a real-time interpolated\\ntesting and re-study intervention. our attention-aware technology\\nworks as follows. learners read a text on a computer screen using\\na self-paced screen-by-screen (also called page-by-page) reading\\nparadigm. we track eye-gaze during reading using a remote eye\\ntracker that does not restrict head movements. we focus on eyegaze for mind wandering detection due to decades of research\\nsuggesting a tight coupling between attentional focus and eye\\nmovements during reading [36]. when mind wandering is\\ndetected, the system intervenes in an attempt to redirect\\nattentional focus and correct any comprehension deficits that\\nmight arise due to mind wandering. the interventions consist of\\nasking comprehension question on pages where mind wandering\\nwas detected and providing opportunities to re-read based on\\nlearners’ responses. in this paper, we discuss the mind wandering\\n\\nmind wandering is also unfortunately an under-addressed\\nproblem in education and is yet to be deeply studied in the context8\\n\\n\\x0cdetector, intervention approach, and results of a summative\\nevaluation study 1.\\n\\n1.1 related work\\nthe idea of attention-aware user interfaces is not new, but was\\nproposed almost a decade ago by roda and thomas [39]. there\\nwas even an article on futuristic applications of attention-aware\\nsystems in educational contexts [35]. prior to this, gluck, et al.\\n[15] discussed the use of eye tracking to increase the bandwidth\\nof information available to an intelligent tutoring system (its).\\nsimilarly, anderson [1] followed up on some of these ideas by\\ndemonstrating how particular beneficial instructional strategies\\ncould only be launched via a real-time analysis of eye gaze.\\nmost of the recent work has been on leveraging eye gaze to\\nincrease the bandwidth of learner models [22, 23, 29]. conati, et\\nal. [5] provide an excellent review of much of the existing work\\nin this area. we can group the research into three categories: (1)\\noffline-analyses of eye gaze to study attentional processes, (2)\\ncomputational modeling of attentional states, and (3) closed-loop\\nsystems that respond to attention in real-time. offline-analysis of\\neye movements has received considerable attention in cognitive\\nand educational psychology for several decades [e.g., 16, 19], so\\nthis area of research is relatively healthy. online computational\\nmodels of learner attention are just beginning to emerge [e.g., 6,\\n11], while closed-loop attention-aware systems are few and far\\nbetween (see [7, 15, 42, 48] for a more or less exhaustive list).\\ntwo known examples, gazetutor and attentivereview, are\\ndiscussed below.\\ngazetutor [7] is a learning technology for biology. it has an\\nanimated conversational agent that provides spoken explanations\\non biology topics which are synchronized with images. the\\nsystem uses a tobii t60 eye tracker to detect inattention, which\\nis assumed to occur when learners’ gaze is not on the tutor agent\\nor image for at least five consecutive seconds. when this occurs,\\nthe system interrupts its speech mid utterance, directs learners to\\nreorient their attention (e.g., “i’m over here you know”), and\\nrepeats speaking from the start of the current utterance. in an\\nevaluation study, 48 learners (undergraduate students) completed\\na learning session on four biology topics with the attention-aware\\ncomponents enabled (experimental group) or disabled (control\\ngroup). the results indicated that gazetutor was successful in\\ndynamically reorienting learners’ attentional patterns towards the\\ninterface. importantly, learning gains for deep reasoning\\nquestions were significantly higher for the experimental vs.\\ncontrol group, but only for high aptitude learners. the results\\nsuggest that even the most basic attention-aware technology can\\nbe effective in improving learning, at least for a subset of learners.\\nhowever, a key limitation is that the researchers simply assumed\\nthat off-screen gaze corresponded to inattention, but did not test\\nthis assumption (e.g., students could have been concentrating\\nwith their eyes closed and this would have been perceived as\\nbeing inattentive).\\nattentivereview [32] is a closed-loop system for mooc learning\\non mobile phones. the system uses video-based\\nphotoplethysmography (ppg) to detect a learners’ heart rate from\\nthe back camera of a smartphone while they view mooc-like\\nlectures on the phone. attentivereview ranks the lectures based\\n1\\n\\non its estimates of learners’ “perceived difficulty,” selecting the\\nmost difficult lecture for subsequent review (called adaptive\\nreview). in a 32-participant between-subjects evaluation study,\\nthe authors found that learning gains obtained from the adaptive\\nreview condition were statistically on par with a full review\\ncondition, but were achieved in 66.7% less review time. although\\nthis result suggests that attentivereview increased learning\\nefficiency, there is the question as to whether the system should\\neven be considered to be an “attention-aware” technology. this is\\nbecause it is arguable if the system has anything to do with\\nattention (except for “attention” appearing in its name) as it\\nselects items for review based on a model of “perceived\\ndifficulty” and not on learners’ “attentional state.” the two might\\nbe related, but are clearly not the same.\\n\\n1.2 novelty\\nour paper focuses on closing the loop between research on\\neducational data and learning outcomes by developing and\\nvalidating the first (in our view) real-time learning technology\\nthat detects and mitigates mind wandering during computerized\\nreading. although automated detection of complex mental states\\nwith the goal of developing intelligent learning technologies that\\nrespond to the sensed states is an active research area (see reviews\\nby [9, 18]), mind wandering has rarely been explored as an aspect\\nof a learner’s mental state that warrants detection and corrective\\naction. and while there has been some work on modeling the\\nlocus of learner attention (see review by [5]), mind wandering is\\ninherently different than more commonly studied forms of\\nattention (e.g., selective attention, distraction), because it involves\\nmore covert forms of involuntary attentional lapses spawned by\\nself-generated internal thought [45]. simply put, mind wandering\\nis a form of “looking without seeing” because the eyes might be\\nfixated on the appropriate external stimulus, but very little is\\nbeing processed as the mind is consumed by stimulusindependent internal thoughts. offline automated approaches to\\ndetect mind wandering have been developed (e.g., [3, 11, 27, 33]),\\nbut these detectors have not yet been used to trigger online\\ninterventions. here, we adapt an offline gaze-based automated\\nmind wandering detector [13] to trigger real-time interventions to\\naddress mind wandering during reading. we conduct a\\nrandomized control trial to evaluate the efficacy of our attentionaware learning technology in improving learning.\\n\\n2. mind wandering detection\\nwe adopted a supervised learning approach for mind wandering\\ndetection. below we provide a high-level overview of the\\napproach; readers are directed to [3, 13] for a detailed discussion\\nof the general approach used to build gaze-based detectors of\\nmind wandering.\\n\\n2.1 training data\\nwe obtained training data from a previous study [26] that\\ninvolved 98 undergraduate students reading a 57-page text on the\\nsurface tension of liquids [4] on a computer screen for an average\\nof 28 minutes. the text contained around 6500 words, with an\\naverage of 115 words per page, and was displayed on a computer\\nscreen with courier new typeface. we recorded eye-gaze with a\\ntobii tx300 eye tracker set to a sampling frequency of 120 hz.\\n\\nthis paper reports updated results of an earlier version [10] presented\\nas a “late-breaking work” (lbw) poster at the 2016 acm chi\\nconference. lbw “extended abstracts” are not included in the main\\nconference proceedings and copyright is retained by the authors.9\\n\\n\\x0cparticipants could read normally and were free to move or gesture\\nas they pleased.\\nparticipants were instructed to report mind wandering (during\\nreading) by pressing a predetermined key when they found\\nthemselves “thinking about the task itself but not the actual\\ncontent of the text” or when they were “thinking about anything\\nelse besides the task.” this is consistent with contemporary\\napproaches (see [45]) that rely on self-reporting because mind\\nwandering is an internal conscious phenomena. further, selfreports of mind wandering have been linked to predictable\\npatterns in physiology [43], pupillometry [14], eye-gaze [37], and\\ntask performance [34], providing validity for this approach.\\n\\non the page, we classified the page as a positive instance of mind\\nwandering. this was done because analyses indicated that\\nparticipants were more likely to be mind wandering in those cases\\n(but see [13] for alternate strategies to handle missing instances).\\n\\non average, we received mind wandering reports for 32% of the\\npages (sd = 20%), although there was considerable variability\\namong participants (ranging from 0% to 82%). self-reported\\nmind wandering negatively correlated (r = -.23, p < .05) with\\nscores on a subsequent comprehension assessment [26], which\\nprovides evidence for the predictive validity of the self-reports.\\n\\n2.2 model building\\nthe stream of eye-gaze data was filtered to produce a series of\\nfixations, saccades, and blinks, from which global eye gaze\\nfeatures were extracted (see figure 1). global features are\\nindependent of the words being read and are therefore more\\ngeneralizable than so-called local features. a full list of 62 global\\nfeatures along with detailed descriptions is provided in [13], but\\nbriefly the features can be grouped into the following four\\ncategories: (1) eye movement descriptive features (n = 48) were\\nstatistical functionals (e.g., min, median) for fixation duration,\\nsaccade duration, saccade amplitude, saccade velocity, and\\nrelative and absolute saccade angle distributions; (2) pupil\\ndiameter descriptive features were statistical functionals (n = 8)\\ncomputed from participant-level z-score standardized estimates\\nof pupil diameter; (3) blink features (n = 2) consisted of the\\nnumber of blinks and the mean blink duration; (4) miscellaneous\\ngaze features (n = 4) consisted of the number of saccades,\\nhorizontal saccade proportion, fixation dispersion, and the\\nfixation duration/saccade duration ratio. we proceeded with a\\nsubset of 32 features after eliminating features exhibiting\\nmulticollinearity.\\nfeatures were calculated from only a certain amount of gaze data\\nfrom each page, called the window. the end of the window was\\npositioned 3 seconds before a self-report so as to not overlap with\\nthe key-press. the average amount of time between self-reports\\nand the beginning of the page was 16 seconds. we used this time\\npoint as the end of the window for pages with no self-report.\\npages that were shorter than the target window size were\\ndiscarded, as were pages with windows that contained fewer than\\nfive gaze fixations as there was insufficient data to compute some\\nof the features. there were a total of 4,225 windows with\\nsufficient data for supervised classification.\\nwe experimented with a number of supervised classifiers on\\nwindow sizes of 4, 8, and 12 seconds to discriminate positive\\n(pages with a self-report = 32%) from negative (pages without a\\nself-report) instances of mind wandering. the training data were\\ndownsampled to achieve a 50% base rate; testing data were\\nunaltered. a leave-one-participant-out validation approach was\\nadopted where models were built on data from n-1 participants\\nand evaluated on the held-out participant. the process was\\nrepeated for all participants. model validation was conducted in a\\nway to simulate a real-time system by analyzing data from every\\npage. when classification was not possible due to a lack of valid\\ngaze data and/or because participants did not spend enough time\\n\\nfigure 1: gaze fixations during mind wandering (top)\\nand normal reading (bottom)\\n\\n2.3 detector accuracy\\nthe best model was a support vector machine that used global\\nfeatures and operated on a window size of 8-seconds. the area\\nunder the roc curve (auc or auroc or a’) was .66, which\\nexceeds the 0.5 chance threshold [17].\\nwe assigned each instance as mind wandering or not mind\\nwandering based on whether the detector’s predicted likelihood\\nof mind wandering (ranges from 0 to 1) was below or above 0.5\\nwe adopted the default 0.5 threshold as it led to a higher rate of\\ntrue positives while maintaining a moderate rate of true negatives.\\nthis resulted in the following confusion matrix shown in table 1.\\nthe model had a weighted precision of 72.2% and a weighted\\nrecall of 67.4%, which we deemed to be sufficiently accurate for\\nintervention.\\ntable 1: proportionalized confusion matrix for mind\\nwandering detection\\npredicted mind wandering

intervention approach is grounded in the basic idea that\\nlearning of conceptual information involves creating and\\nmaintaining an internal model (mental model) by integrating\\ninformation from the text with prior knowledge from memory\\n[25]. this integration process relies on attentional focus and\\nbreaks down during mind wandering because information from\\nthe external environment is no longer being integrated into the\\ninternal mental model. this results in an impaired model which\\nleads to less effective suppression of off-task thoughts. this\\nincrease in mind wandering further impairs the mental model,10\\n\\n\\x0cresulting in a vicious cycle. our intervention targets this vicious\\ncycle by redirecting attention to the primary task and attempting\\nto correct for comprehension deficits attributed to mind\\nwandering. based on research demonstrating the effectiveness of\\ninterpolated testing [47], we propose that asking questions on\\npages where mind wandering is detected and encouraging rereading in response to incorrect responses will aid in re-directing\\nattention to the text and correct knowledge deficits.\\n\\npage regardless of whether the second question was answered\\ncorrectly, so as not to be overly burdensome.\\n\\n3.1 intervention implementation\\nour initial intervention was implemented for the same text used\\nto create the mind wandering detector (although it could be\\napplied to any text). the text was integrated into the computer\\nreading interface. mind wandering detection occurred when the\\nlearner navigated to the next page using the right arrow key. in\\norder to address ambiguity in mind wandering detection, we used\\nthe detector’s mind wandering likelihood to probabilistically\\ndetermine when to intervene. for example, if the mind wandering\\nlikelihood was 70%, then there was a 70% chance of intervention\\non any given page (all else being equal). we did not intervene for\\nthe first three pages in order to allow the learner to become\\nfamiliar with the text and interface. to reduce disruption, there\\nwas a 50% reduced probability of intervening on adjacent pages,\\nand the maximum number of interventions was capped at 1/3 ×\\nthe number of pages (19 for the present 57-page text). table 2\\npresents pseudo code for when to launch an intervention.\\ntable 2: pseudo code for intervention

presents an outline of the intervention strategy. the\\nintervention itself relied on two multiple choice questions for\\neach page (screen) of the text. when the system decided to\\nintervene, one of the questions (randomly selected) was presented\\nto the learner. if the learner answered this online question\\ncorrectly, positive feedback was provided, and the learner could\\nadvance to the next page. if the learner answered incorrectly,\\nnegative feedback was provided, and the system encouraged the\\nlearner to re-read the page. the learner was then provided with a\\nsecond (randomly selected) online question, which could either\\nbe the same or the alternate question for that page. feedback was\\nnot provided and the learner was allowed to advance to the next\\n\\nfigure 2: outline of intervention strategy\\n\\n3.2 iterative refinement\\nthe technology was refined through multiple rounds of formative\\ntesting with 67 participants, recruited from the same institution\\nused to build the detector. participants were observed while\\ninteracting with the technology, their responses were analyzed,\\nand they were interviewed about their experience. we used the\\nfeedback gleaned from these tests to refine the intervention\\nparameters (i.e., when to launch, how many interventions to\\nlaunch, whether to launch interventions on subsequent pages),\\nintervention questions themselves, and instructions on how to\\nattend to the intervention. for example, earlier versions of the\\nintervention used a fixed threshold (instead of the aforementioned\\nprobabilistic approach) to trigger an intervention. despite many\\nattempts to set this threshold, the end result was that some\\nparticipants received many interventions while others received\\nalmost no interventions. this issue was corrected by\\nprobabilistically rather than deterministically launching the\\nintervention. additional testing/refinement of the comprehension\\nquestions used in the intervention was done using crowdsourcing\\nplatforms, specifically amazon’s mechanical turk (mturk).\\n\\n4. evaluation study\\nwe conducted a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the\\ntechnology. the experiment had two conditions: an intervention\\ncondition and a yoked control condition (as described below). the\\nyoked control was needed to verify that any learning benefits are\\nattributed to the technology being sensitive to mind wandering\\nand not merely to the added opportunities to answer online\\nquestions and re-read. this is because we know that interpolated\\ntesting itself has beneficial comprehension effects [47].\\n\\n4.1 method\\nparticipants (n = 104) were a new set of undergraduate students\\nwho participated to fulfill research credit requirements. they\\nwere recruited from the same university used to build the mw\\ndetector and for the iterative testing and refinement cycles.\\nwe did not use a pretest because we expected participants to be\\nunfamiliar with the topic. participants were not informed that the\\ninterface would be tracking their mind wandering (until the11\\n\\n\\x0cdebriefing at the end), instead, they were instructed as follows:\\n“while reading the text, you will occasionally be asked some\\nquestions about the page you just read. depending on your\\nanswer, you will re-read the same page and you will be asked\\nanother question that may or may not be the same question.”\\nparticipants in the intervention condition received the\\nintervention as described above (i.e., based on detected mind\\nwandering likelihoods). each participant in the yoked control\\ncondition was paired with a participant in the intervention\\ncondition. he or she received an intervention question on the\\nsame pages as their paired intervention participant regardless of\\nmind wandering likelihood. for example, if participant a (i.e.,\\nintervention condition) received questions on pages 5, 7, 10, and\\n25, participant b (i.e., yoked control condition) would receive\\nintervention questions on the same pages. however, if the yoked\\nparticipant answered incorrectly, then (s)he had the opportunity\\nto re-read and answer another question regardless of the outcome\\nof their intervention-condition partner.\\nafter reading, participants completed a 38-item multiple choice\\ncomprehension assessment to measure learning. the questions\\nwere randomly selected from the 57 pages (one per page) with the\\nexception that a higher selection priority was given to pages that\\nwere re-read on account of the intervention. participants in the\\nyoked control condition received the same posttest questions as\\ntheir intervention condition counterparts.\\n\\n4.2 results\\nparticipants received an average of 16 (min of 7 and max of 19)\\ninterventions. they spent an average of 27.5 seconds on each\\nscreen prior to receiving an intervention. there was no significant\\ndifference across conditions (p = .998), suggesting that reading\\ntime was not a confound. in what follows, we compared each\\nintervention participant to his/her yoked control with a two-tailed\\npaired-samples t-test and a 0.05 criteria for statistical\\nsignificance.\\nmind wandering detection. the detector’s likelihood of mind\\nwandering was slightly higher for participants in the yokedcontrol condition (m = .431; sd = .170) compared to the\\nintervention condition (m = .404; sd = .112), but the difference\\nwas not statistically significant (p = .348). this was unsurprising\\nas participants in both groups received the same interventions,\\nwhich itself was expected to reduce mind wandering. importantly,\\nmind wandering likelihoods were negatively correlated with\\nperformance on the online questions (r = -.296, p = .033) as well\\nas on posttest questions (r = -.319, p = .021). this provides\\nevidence for the validity of the mind wandering detector when\\napplied to a new set of learners and under different conditions\\n(i.e., reading interspersed with online questions compared to\\nuninterrupted reading).\\ncomprehension assessment. there was some overlap between\\nthe online questions and the posttest questions. to obtain an\\nunbiased estimate of learning, we only analyzed performance on\\npreviously unseen posttest questions. that is, questions that were\\nused as part of the intervention were first removed before\\ncomputing posttest scores.\\nthere were no significant condition differences on overall\\nposttest scores (p = .846). the intervention condition answered\\n57.6% (sd = .157) of the questions correctly while the yoked\\ncontrol condition answered 58.1% (sd = .129) correctly. this\\nfinding was not surprising as both conditions received the exact\\nsame treatment except that the interventions were triggered based\\n\\non detected mind wandering in the intervention condition but not\\nthe control condition.\\nnext, we examined posttest performance as a function of mind\\nwandering during reading. each page was designated as a low or\\nhigh mind wandering page based on a median split of mind\\nwandering likelihoods (medians = .35 and .36 on a 0 to 1 scale for\\nintervention and control conditions, respectively). we then\\nanalyzed performance on posttest questions corresponding to\\npages with low vs. high likelihoods of mind wandering (during\\nreading). the results are shown in table 3.\\nwe found no significant posttest differences on pages where both\\nthe intervention and control participants had low (p = .759) or\\nhigh (p = .922) mind wandering likelihoods (first and last rows in\\ntable 3, respectively). there was also no significant posttest\\ndifference (p = .630) for pages where the intervention condition\\nhad high mind wandering likelihoods but the control condition\\nhad low mind wandering likelihoods (row 3). however, the\\nintervention condition significantly (p = .003, d = .47 sigma)\\noutperformed the control condition for pages where the\\nintervention participants had low likelihoods of mind wandering\\nbut control participants had high mind wandering likelihoods\\n(row 2). these last two finding suggests that the intervention had\\nthe intended effect of reducing comprehension deficits\\nattributable to mind wandering because it led to equitable\\nperformance when mind wandering was high and improved\\nperformance when it was low.\\ntable 3: posttest performance (proportion of correct\\nresponses) as a function of mind wandering

multiple-choice questions. this was good.\\nhowever, participants also reported that they adapted their\\nreading strategies in one of two ways in response to the questions.\\nsince the questions targeted factual information (sometimes\\nverbatim) from the text, some participants paid more attention to\\ndetails and precise wordings instead of the broader concepts being\\ndiscussed in the text. more discouragingly, some participants\\nreported adopting a preemptive skimming strategy in that they\\nwould only look for keywords that they expected to appear in a\\nsubsequent question.\\nparticipants were encouraged to re-read text when they answered\\nincorrectly before receiving another question (or the same\\nquestion in some cases). many participants reported simply\\nscanning the text (when re-reading) to locate keywords from the\\nquestion before moving on. since the scanning strategy was often12\\n\\n\\x0csuccessful to answer the subsequent question, participants\\nreported that the questions were too easy and it took relatively\\nlittle effort to locate the correct answer compared to re-reading.\\nthey suggested that it may have been better if the questions had\\ntargeted key concepts rather than facts.\\nfinally, participants reported difficulties with re-engaging with\\nthe text after answering an online question because the text was\\ncleared when an intervention question was displayed; an item that\\ncan be easily corrected in subsequent versions.\\n\\n5. discussion\\nwe developed the first educational technology capable of realtime mind wandering detection and dynamic intervention during\\ncomputerized reading. in the remainder of this section, we discuss\\nthe significance of our main findings, limitations, and avenues for\\nfuture work.\\n\\n5.1 significance of main findings\\nwe have three main findings. first, we demonstrated that a\\nmachine-learned mind wandering detector built in one context\\ncan be applied to a different (albeit related) interaction context.\\nspecifically, the detector was trained on a data set involving\\nparticipants silently reading and self-reporting mind wandering,\\nbut was applied to an interactive context involving interpolated\\nassessments, which engendered different reading strategies.\\nfurther, self-reports of mind wandering were not collected in this\\ninteractive context, which might have influenced mind wandering\\nrates in and of itself. despite these differences, we were able to\\ndemonstrate the predictive validity of the detector by showing\\nthat it negatively correlated with both online and offline\\ncomprehension scores when evaluated on new participants.\\nsecond, we showed promising effects for our intervention\\napproach despite a very conservative experimental design, which\\nensured that the intervention and control groups were equated\\nalong all respects, except that the intervention was triggered based\\non the mind wandering detector (key manipulation). further, we\\nused a probabilistic approach to trigger an intervention, because\\nthe detector is inherently imperfect. as a result, participants could\\nhave received an intervention when they were not mind\\nwandering and/or could have failed to receive one when they were\\nmind wandering. therefore, it was essential to compare the two\\ngroups under conditions when the mind wandering levels\\ndiffered. this more nuanced analysis revealed that although the\\nintervention itself did not lead to a boost in overall comprehension\\n(because it is remedial), it equated comprehension scores when\\nmind wandering was high (i.e., scores for the intervention group\\nwere comparable when the control group was low on mind\\nwandering). it also demonstrated the cost of not intervening\\nduring mind wandering (i.e., scores for the intervention group\\nwere greater when the control group was high on mind\\nwandering). in other words, the intervention was successful in\\nmitigating the negative effects of mind wandering.\\nthird, despite the advantages articulated above, the intervention\\nitself was reactive and engendered several unintended (and\\npresumably suboptimal) behaviors. in particular, students altered\\ntheir reading strategies in response to the interpolated questions,\\nwhich were a critical part of the intervention. in a sense, they\\nattempted to “game the intervention” by attempting to proactively\\npredict the types of questions they might receive and then\\nadopting a complementary reading strategy consisting of\\nskimming and/or focusing on factual information. this reliance\\non surface- rather than deeper-levels of processing was\\nincongruent with our goal of promoting deep comprehension.\\n\\n5.2 limitations\\nthere are a number of methodological limitations with this work\\nthat go beyond limitations with the intervention (as discussed\\nabove). first, we focused on a single text that is perceived as\\nbeing quite dull and consequently triggers rather high levels of\\nmind wandering [26]. this raises the question of whether the\\ndetector will generalize to different texts. we expect some level\\nof generalizability in terms of features used because the detector\\nonly used content- and position- (on the screen) free global gaze\\nfeatures. however, given that several supervised classifiers are\\nvery sensitive to differences in base rates, the detector might overor under- predict mind wandering when applied to texts that\\nengender different rates of mind wandering. therefore, retraining\\nthe detector with a more diverse set of texts is warranted.\\nanother limitation is the scalability of our learning technology.\\nthe eye tracker we used was a cost-prohibitive tobii tx300 that\\nwill not scale beyond the laboratory. fortunately, commercialoff-the-shelf (cots) eye trackers, such as eye tribe and tobii\\neyex, can be used to surpass this limitation. it is an open question\\nas to whether the mind wandering detector can operate with\\nsimilar fidelity with these cots eye trackers. our use of global\\ngaze features which do not require high-precision eye tracking\\nholds considerable promise in this regard. nevertheless,\\nreplication with scalable eye trackers and/or scalable alternatives\\nto eye tracking (e.g., facial-feature tracking [46] or monitoring\\nreading patterns [27]) is an important next step (see section 5.3).\\nour use of surface-level questions for both the intervention and\\nthe subsequent comprehension assessment is also a limitation as\\nis the lack of a delayed comprehension assessment. it might be\\nthe case that the intervention effects manifest as richer encodings\\nin long-term memory, a possibility that cannot be addressed in the\\ncurrent experiment that only assessed immediate learning.\\nother limitations include a limited student sample (i.e.\\nundergraduates from a private midwestern college) and a\\nlaboratory setup. it is possible that the results would not\\ngeneralize to a more diverse student population or in more\\necological environments (but see below for evidence of\\ngeneralizability of the detector in classroom environments).\\nreplication with data from more diverse populations and\\nenvironments would be a necessary next step to increase the\\necological validity of this work.\\n\\n5.3 future work\\nour future work is progressing along two main fronts. one is to\\naddress limitations in the intervention and design of the\\nexperimental evaluation as discussed above. accordingly, we are\\nexploring alternative intervention strategies, such as: (a) tagging\\nitems for future re-study rather than interrupting participants\\nduring reading; (b) highlighting specific portions of the text as an\\novert cue to facilitate comprehension of critical information; (c)\\nasking fewer intervention questions, but selecting inference\\nquestions that target deeper levels of comprehension and that span\\nmultiple pages of the text; and (d) asking learners to engage in\\nreflection by providing written self-explanations of the textual\\ncontent. we are currently evaluating one such redesigned\\nintervention – open-ended questions targeting deeper levels of\\ncomprehension (item c). our revised experimental design taps\\nboth surface- and inference-level comprehension and assesses\\ncomprehension immediately after reading (to measure learning)\\nand after a one-week delay (to measure retention).\\nwe are also developing attention-aware versions of more\\ninteractive interfaces, such as learning with an intelligent tutoring13\\n\\n\\x0csystem called gurututor [30]. this project also addresses some\\nof the scalability concerns by replacing expensive research-grade\\neye tracking with cost-effective cots eye tracking (e.g., the eye\\ntribe or tobii eyex) and provides evidence for real-world\\ngeneralizability by collecting data in classrooms rather than the\\nlab. we recently tested our implementation on 135 students (total)\\nin a noisy computer-enabled high-school classroom where eyegaze of entire classes of students was collected during their\\nnormal class periods [20]. using a similar approach to the present\\nwork, we used the data to build and validate a studentindependent gaze-based mind wandering detector. the resultant\\nmind wandering detection accuracy (f1 of 0.59) was substantially\\ngreater than chance (f1 of 0.24) and outperformed earlier work on\\nthe same domain [21]. the next step is to develop interventions\\nthat redirect attention and correct learning deficiencies\\nattributable to mind wandering and to test the interventions in\\nreal-world environments. by doing so, we hope to advance our\\nfoundational vision of developing next-generation technologies\\nthat enhance the process and products of learning by “attending\\nto attention.”\\n\\n[6]\\n\\n[7]\\n\\n[8]\\n\\n[9]\\n\\n[10]\\n\\n[11]\\n\\n[12]\\nfigure 3: guru tutor interface overlaid with eye-gaze\\nobtained via the eyetribe\\n\\n[13]\\n\\n6.

      "will not scale beyond the laboratory. fortunately, commercialoff-the-shelf (cots) eye trackers, such as eye tribe and tobii\n",
